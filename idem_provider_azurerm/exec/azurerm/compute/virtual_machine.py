    Create or update a virtual machine.

    :param name: The virtual machine to create.

    :param resource_group: The resource group name assigned to the virtual machine.

    :param vm_size: The size of the virtual machine.

    :param admin_username: Specifies the name of the administrator account.

    :param os_disk_create_option: (attach, from_image, or empty) Specifies how the virtual machine should be created.
        The "attach" value is used when you are using a specialized disk to create the virtual machine. The "from_image"
        value is used when you are using an image to create the virtual machine. If you are using a platform image, you
        also use the image_reference element. If you are using a marketplace image, you also use the plan element.

    :param os_disk_size_gb: Specifies the size of an empty OS disk in gigabytes. This element can be used to overwrite
        the size of the disk in a virtual machine image.

    :param ssh_public_keys: The list of SSH public keys used to authenticate with Linux based VMs.

    :param disable_password_auth: (only on Linux) Specifies whether password authentication should be disabled when SSH
        public keys are provided.

    :param custom_data: (only on Linux) Specifies a base-64 encoded string of custom data for cloud-init (not user-data
        scripts). The base-64 encoded string is decoded to a binary array that is saved as a file on the Virtual
        Machine. The maximum length of the binary array is 65535 bytes. For using cloud-init for your VM, see `Using
        cloud-init to customize a Linux VM during creation
        <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/using-cloud-init>`_

    :param allow_extensions: Specifies whether extension operations should be allowed on the virtual machine. This may
        only be set to False when no extensions are present on the virtual machine.

    :param enable_automatic_updates: (only on Windows) Indicates whether Automatic Updates is enabled for the Windows
        virtual machine. Default value is true. For virtual machine scale sets, this property can be updated and updates
        will take effect on OS reprovisioning.

    :param time_zone: (only on Windows) Specifies the time zone of the virtual machine. e.g. "Pacific Standard Time"

    :param allocate_public_ip: Create and attach a public IP object to the VM.

    :param create_interfaces: Create network interfaces to attach to the VM if none are provided.

    :param network_resource_group: Specify the resource group of the network components referenced in this module.

    :param virtual_network: Virtual network for the subnet which will contain the network interfaces.

    :param subnet: Subnet to which the network interfaces will be attached.

    :param network_interfaces: A list of network interface references ({"id": "/full/path/to/object"}) to attach.

    :param os_managed_disk: A managed disk resource ID or dictionary containing the managed disk parameters. If a
        dictionary is provided, "storage_account_type" can be passed in additional to the "id". Storage account type for
        the managed disk can include: 'Standard_LRS', 'Premium_LRS', 'StandardSSD_LRS', 'UltraSSD_LRS'. NOTE:
        UltraSSD_LRS can only be used with data disks.

    :param os_disk_vhd_uri: The virtual hard disk for the OS ({"uri": "/full/path/to/object"}).

    :param os_disk_image_uri: The source user image virtual hard disk ({"uri": "/full/path/to/object"}). The virtual
        hard disk will be copied before being attached to the virtual machine. If SourceImage is provided, the
        destination virtual hard drive must not exist.

    :param os_type: (linux or windows) This property allows you to specify the type of the OS that is included in the
        disk if creating a VM from user-image or a specialized VHD.

    :param os_disk_name: The OS disk name. Note that setting this may cause conflicts upon re-deployment of a virtual
        machine if the old OS disk isn't cleaned up. Use `os_disk_create_option="attach"` to attach a named disk.

    :param os_disk_simplename: If set to `True`, a "simple" name is used for the OS disk name instead of the randomized
        name used by default in Azure. Note that setting this may cause conflicts upon re-deployment of a virtual
        machine if the old OS disk isn't cleaned up. Use `os_disk_create_option="attach"` to attach a named disk.

    :param data_disk_simplenames: If set to `True`, a "simple" name is used for data disk names instead of the
        randomized names used by default in Azure. Note that setting this may cause conflicts upon re-deployment of a
        virtual machine if the old disk isn't cleaned up. Use `create_option="attach"` to attach a named disk.

    :param os_disk_caching: (read_only, read_write, or none) Specifies the caching requirements. Defaults
        to "None" for Standard storage and "ReadOnly" for Premium storage.

    :param os_write_accel: Boolean value specifies whether write accelerator should be enabled or disabled on the disk.

    :param os_ephemeral_disk: Boolean value to enable ephemeral "diff" OS disk. `Ephemeral OS disks
        <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/ephemeral-os-disks>`_ are created on the local
        virtual machine (VM) storage and not saved to the remote Azure Storage.

    :param ultra_ssd_enabled: The flag that enables or disables a capability to have one or more managed data disks with
        UltraSSD_LRS storage account type on the VM or VMSS. Managed disks with storage account type UltraSSD_LRS can be
        added to a virtual machine or virtual machine scale set only if this property is enabled.

    :param image: A pipe-delimited representation of an image to use, in the format of "publisher|offer|sku|version".
        Examples - "OpenLogic|CentOS|7.7|latest" or "Canonical|UbuntuServer|18.04-LTS|latest"

    :param boot_diags_enabled: Enables boots diagnostics on the Virtual Machine. Required for use of the
        diag_storage_uri parameter.

    :param diag_storage_uri: Enables boots diagnostics on the Virtual Machine by passing the URI of the storage account
        to use for placing the console output and screenshot.

    :param admin_password: Specifies the password of the administrator account. Note that there are minimum length,
        maximum length, and complexity requirements imposed on this password. See the Azure documentation for details.

    :param provision_vm_agent: Indicates whether virtual machine agent should be provisioned on the virtual machine.
        When this property is not specified in the request body, default behavior is to set it to true. This will ensure
        that VM Agent is installed on the VM so that extensions can be added to the VM later. If attempting to set this
        value, os_type should also be set in order to ensure the proper OS configuration is used.

    :param userdata_file: This parameter can contain a local or web path for a userdata script. If a local file is used,
        then the contents of that file will override the contents of the userdata parameter. If a web source is used,
        then the userdata parameter should contain the command to execute the script file. For instance, if a file
        location of https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saltstack/salt-bootstrap/stable/bootstrap-salt.sh is used then the
        userdata parameter would contain "./bootstrap-salt.sh" along with any desired arguments. Note that PowerShell
        execution policy may cause issues here. For PowerShell files, considered signed scripts or the more insecure
        "powershell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -File ./bootstrap-salt.ps1" addition to the command.

    :param userdata: This parameter is used to pass text to be executed on a system. The native shell will be used on a
        given host operating system.

    :param max_price: Specifies the maximum price you are willing to pay for a Azure Spot VM/VMSS. This price is in US
        Dollars. This price will be compared with the current Azure Spot price for the VM size. Also, the prices are
        compared at the time of create/update of Azure Spot VM/VMSS and the operation will only succeed if max_price is
        greater than the current Azure Spot price. The max_price will also be used for evicting a Azure Spot VM/VMSS if
        the current Azure Spot price goes beyond the maxPrice after creation of VM/VMSS. Possible values are any decimal
        value greater than zero (example: 0.01538) or -1 indicates default price to be up-to on-demand. You can set the
        max_price to -1 to indicate that the Azure Spot VM/VMSS should not be evicted for price reasons. Also, the
        default max price is -1 if it is not provided by you.

    :param availability_set: Specifies information about the availability set that the virtual machine should be
        assigned to. Virtual machines specified in the same availability set are allocated to different nodes to
        maximize availability. For more information about availability sets, see `Manage the availability of virtual
        machines <https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/virtual-machines-windows-manage-availability>`_.
        Currently, a VM can only be added to availability set at creation time. An existing VM cannot be added to an
        availability set. (resource ID path)

    :param virtual_machine_scale_set: Specifies information about the virtual machine scale set that the virtual machine
        should be assigned to. Virtual machines specified in the same virtual machine scale set are allocated to
        different nodes to maximize availability. Currently, a VM can only be added to virtual machine scale set at
        creation time. An existing VM cannot be added to a virtual machine scale set. This property cannot exist along
        with a non-null availability_set reference. (resource ID path)

    :param proximity_placement_group: Specifies information about the proximity placement group that the virtual machine
        should be assigned to.

    :param priority: (low or regular) Specifies the priority for the virtual machine.

    :param eviction_policy: (deallocate or delete) Specifies the eviction policy for the Azure Spot virtual machine.

    :param license_type: (Windows_Client or Windows_Server) Specifies that the image or disk that is being used was
        licensed on-premises. This element is only used for images that contain the Windows Server operating system.

    :param zones: A list of the virtual machine zones.

    Virtual Machine Disk Encryption:
        If you would like to enable disk encryption within the virtual machine you must set the enable_disk_enc
        parameter to True. Disk encryption utilizes a VM published by Microsoft.Azure.Security of extension type
        AzureDiskEncryptionForLinux or AzureDiskEncryption, depending on your virtual machine OS. More information
        about Disk Encryption and its requirements can be found in the links below.

        Disk Encryption for Windows Virtual Machines:
        https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/disk-encryption-overview

        Disk Encryption for Linux Virtual Machines:
        https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/disk-encryption-overview

        The following parameters may be used to implement virtual machine disk encryption:
        :param enable_disk_enc: This boolean flag will represent whether disk encryption has been enabled for the
            virtual machine. This is a required parameter.

        :param disk_enc_keyvault: The resource ID of the key vault containing the disk encryption key, which is a
            Key Vault Secret. This is a required parameter.

        :param disk_enc_volume_type: The volume type(s) that will be encrypted. Possible values include: 'OS',
            'Data', and 'All'. This is a required parameter.

        :param disk_enc_kek_url: The Key Identifier URL for a Key Encryption Key (KEK). The KEK is used as an
            additional layer of security for encryption keys. Azure Disk Encryption will use the KEK to wrap the
            encryption secrets before writing to the Key Vault. The KEK must be in the same vault as the encryption
            secrets. This is an optional parameter.

    Attaching Data Disks:
        Data disks can be attached by passing a list of dictionaries in the data_disks parameter. The dictionaries in
        the list can have the following parameters.

        :param lun: (optional int) Specifies the logical unit number of the data disk. This value is used to identify
            data disks within the VM and therefore must be unique for each data disk attached to a VM. If not
            provided, we increment the lun designator based upon the index within the provided list of disks.

        :param name: (optional str) The disk name. Defaults to "{vm_name}-datadisk{lun}"

        :param vhd: (optional str or dict) Virtual hard disk to use. If a URI string is provided, it will be nested
            under a "uri" key in a dictionary as expected by the SDK.

        :param image: (optional str or dict) The source user image virtual hard disk. The virtual hard disk will be
            copied before being attached to the virtual machine. If image is provided, the destination virtual hard
            drive must not exist. If a URI string is provided, it will be nested under a "uri" key in a dictionary as
            expected by the SDK.

        :param caching: (optional str - read_only, read_write, or none) Specifies the caching requirements. Defaults to
            "None" for Standard storage and "ReadOnly" for Premium storage.

        :param write_accelerator_enabled: (optional bool - True or False) Specifies whether write accelerator should be
            enabled or disabled on the disk.

        :param create_option: (optional str - attach, from_image, or empty) Specifies how the virtual machine should be
            created. The "attach" value is used when you are using a specialized disk to create the virtual machine. The
            "from_image" value is used when you are using an image to create the virtual machine. If you are using a
            platform image, you also use the image_reference element. If you are using a marketplace image, you also use
            the plan element.

        :param disk_size_gb: (optional int) Specifies the size of an empty data disk in gigabytes. This element can be
            used to overwrite the size of the disk in a virtual machine image.

        :param managed_disk: (optional str or dict) The managed disk parameters. If an ID string is provided, it will
            be nested under an "id" key in a dictionary as expected by the SDK. If a dictionary is provided, the
            "storage_account_type" parameter can be passed (accepts (Standard|Premium)_LRS or (Standard|Ultra)SSD_LRS).
